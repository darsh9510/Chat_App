## Testing Details
The testing of the project was done on Selenium IDE, where various test cases were recorded and re-reun multiple times to ensure the testing. The scripts generated from therer were then exported and made changes in the those exportede python scripts and tested using web-driver. So, thorough testing  was done both on Selenium IDE and Web-Driver.
